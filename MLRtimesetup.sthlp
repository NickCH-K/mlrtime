{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:MLRtimesetup} will install the Stata packages {cmd: github} and 
{cmd: rcall} referenced in {browse 
"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1536867X19830891?journalCode=stja"
:Haghish (2019)}, as well as every R package necessary to run every function in 
MLRtime.
The Stata packages will be downloaded from GitHub and not ssc.

{pstd}
R must be installed first before running {cmd:MLRtimesetup}, and R must be 
callable from the command line.
You can install R at {browse "https://www.r-project.org/":R-Project.org}.
If after installing R, {cmd: rcall} is still having trouble finding your R 
installation, see the {browse "http://www.haghish.com/packages/Rcall.php":rcall 
website} for troubleshooting tips.
Likely, your R installation is just not where it expects.

{pstd}
The use of any MLRtime function will often result in flashing blue screens.
If you are photosensitive you may want to look away.

{pstd}
If {cmd:rcall} seems to be working fine, but R package installation is giving 
you problems, then open up R and copy/paste the following commands one at a 
time.
If one fails, check the error message to see if it's something you can fix 
(sometimes you need to delete the "00LOCK" folder that shows up in your 
subdirectory of R packages), or maybe just try it again before moving on to the 
next:

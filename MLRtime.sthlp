{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:MLRtime} is a package designed to make it easier for Stata to interface with R's machine learning tools, using {help rcall} (Haghish, 2019). 

{pstd}
{cmd:MLRtime} the {it: command} is really just here so something will pop up when you type {cmd: help MLRtime} after installing it.

{pstd}
The actual commands of interest are: {help MLRtimesetup} which will set up your machine properly, {help grf} for running honest random forests, including causal forests, {help gsynth} for the generalized synthetic control method, including matrix completion, and {help ranger} for running random forests.

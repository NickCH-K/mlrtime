{syntab:Main}
{synopt:{opt target_sample(string)}} Which sample to aggregate treatment effects
 over.
This can be "all" (the default).
For causal forests you can alternately select "treated", "control", or 
"overlap".{p_end}
{synopt:{opt method(string)}} Method used for doubly robust inference.
Can be either augmented inverse-propensity weighting (AIPW), or targeted maximum
 likelihood estimation (TMLE).
Note: TMLE is currently only implemented for causal forests with a binary 
treatment..{p_end}
{synopt:{opt subset(string)}} A variable name for a variable that was 
{it:in the data before the call to {cmd: grf}} that specifies the subset of the
 training examples over which we estimate the ATE.
WARNING: For valid statistical performance, the subset should be defined only 
using features Xi, not using the treatment or the outcome.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt debiasing_weights(string)}} A variable name for a variable that 
was {it:in the data before the call to {cmd: grf}} giving the debiasing weights.
If not specified these are obtained via the appropriate doubly robust score 
construction, e.g., in the case of causal_forests with a binary treatment, 
they are obtained via inverse-propensity weighting.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt compliance_score(string)}} Only used with instrumental forests.
A variable name for a variable that was {it:in the data before the call to 
{cmd: grf}} Only used with instrumental forests.
An estimate of the causal effect of instrument Z on treatment W, i.e., 
Delta(X) = E[W | X, Z = 1] - E[W | X, Z = 0], which can then be used to produce 
debiasing_weights.
If not provided, this is estimated via an auxiliary causal forest.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt num_trees_for_weights(integer)}} In some cases (e.g., with causal 
forests with a continuous treatment), we need to train auxiliary forests to 
learn debiasing weights.
This is the number of trees used for this task.
Note: this argument is ignored if {opt debiasing_weights} is specified.{p_end}

{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:grf_ate} is an interface between Stata and the "average_treatment_effect" 
function in the R package {cmd: grf}, by Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2019).

{pstd}
This is a postestimation function for {cmd:grf} specified with either the 
{opt forest_type(causal_forest)} or {opt forest_type(instrumental_forest)} 
options, and will calculate an average treatment effect for the estimated 
forest.
See {cmd: rcall: help(average_treatment_effect, package = 'grf')} or 
{browse "https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/"} for more information.

{pstd}
Results will be printed to screen, and also stored in {cmd: r(estimate)} and 
{cmd: r(std.err)}.

{pstd}
Unfortunately, troubleshooting your model if it does not work is rather 
difficult when using a wrapper like this.
You can get some help on the GitHub page at 
{browse "https://github.com/NickCH-K/MLRtime"} but I can't help everyone, you 
may be a bit on your own.
You may be able to use {cmd: rcall} to see what error messages come up if things
 are not being returned to Stata.

{pstd}
The use of any MLRtime function will often result in flashing blue screens.
If you are photosensitive you may want to look away.

Note that this syntax example produces some strange results, but this is an

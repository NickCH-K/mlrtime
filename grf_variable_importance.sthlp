{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:grf_variable_importance} is an interface between Stata and the "variable_importance" function in the R package {cmd: grf}, by Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager (2019).

{pstd}
This is a postestimation function for {cmd:grf}, and can be used with any of the forests.
See {cmd: rcall: help(variable_importance, package = 'grf')} or {browse "https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/"} for more information.
Note that this will report variable importance using the {it: system} variable names, which likely don't match what you expect if you used factor variables or time-series operators in your list of predictors.
Creating lag/lead or dummy variables ahead of time and naming them yourself is adviced if you plan to use {cmd: grf_variable_importance}.

{pstd}
This function creates an "importance value" of each predictor and how important it is in building the tree.
It is a simple weighted sum of how many times a given predictor was split on at each depth in the forest.


{pstd}
Unfortunately, troubleshooting your model if it does not work is rather difficult when using a wrapper like this.
You can get some help on the GitHub page at {browse "https://github.com/NickCH-K/MLRtime"} but I can't help everyone, you may be a bit on your own.
You may be able to use {cmd: rcall} to see what error messages come up if things are not being returned to Stata.

{pstd}
The use of any MLRtime function will often result in flashing blue screens.
If you are photosensitive you may want to look away.
